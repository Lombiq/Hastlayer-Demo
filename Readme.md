# Hastlayer Demo readme



This is a sample project that utilizes [Hastlayer](https://hastlayer.com/) to accelerate computations with [FPGAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array).

While you won't be able to run this code without Hastlayer you'll be able to get an idea of how the system can be used. Hastlayer will be published in the near future; if you're interested in it today just [get in touch with us](https://lombiq.com/contact-us).

The project's source is available in two public source repositories, automatically mirrored in both directions with [Git-hg Mirror](https://githgmirror.com):

- [https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/hastlayer-demo](https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/hastlayer-demo) (Mercurial repository)
- [https://github.com/Lombiq/Hastlayer-Demo](https://github.com/Lombiq/Hastlayer-Demoe) (Git repository)

Bug reports, feature requests and comments are warmly welcome, **please do so via GitHub**.
